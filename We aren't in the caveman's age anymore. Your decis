We aren't in the caveman's age anymore. Your decision is not forced by the nature or its consequences like in a jungle. It came by your preference wherin we already have numerous other choices. A prefrence for which others have to pay.

Had it been a natural scenario when you were out of options and your survival instincts would have kicked in, I'd have respected that. But hiding ones guilt in name of food cycle ain't cool.

And I'd be more than happy if you could enlighten me by explaining how the ecosystem collapses if humans stop eating meat. Not to mention we are the very ones who have been breeding them radically by biological means for our food. 

Let me tell you one thing bold and clear, neither Sansui nor Flipkart cares about after sales services. Even after spending so much money I am left with a useless equipment and flipkart is of no help. Very poor service from Sansui and #Flopkart as well. 

The compressor unit has no gas in it. It might be because of leakage or there was no gas from the beginning. In either case I have been sent a faulty product for which Flipkart is responsible. 

One would naturally expect Flipkart to help out, but to my surprise when I contacted Flipkart they said we cannot help here and asked me to contact the company. Nobody is responding from the company side. So even the company Sansui is not trustworthy. Avoid this AC if you want to save your time and money. 

Edit 1: After nearly 20 days I finally ended up spending 4000Rs extra for gas filling. My only mistake was that I couldn't wait for any more time and installed the product from the local service guy. 

Sequence of events 
1) AC delivered after 11 Days
2) Installation notification asked to wait for 7-8 days
3) Waited 2 days, contacted Sansui customer care, no proper response, asked me to wait for 4-5 days
4) Called a local service guy and he started installing the AC, in midway I service guy got to know that there is no gas in compressor unit. (declaring the piece as faulty, either there is no gas or there is a leakage)
5) Called flipkart to inform, they asked me to wait for sometime before they get a followup
6) They organized a technician visit for inspection which was due to come in 3 days.
7) On third day surprisingly the technician called to inform that they don't provide service for things bought online and I should handle the matters with local service guys. When I insisted that it is his job he started demanded 3500Rs (WTF moment for me) 
8) Informed Flipkart about this nonsense. Flipkart again asked to wait for some more days.

Finally after 20 days I lost my patience a serviced the AC from the local service guy for 4000Rs

The  basic purpose of buying things online is the competitive price. But if one is not ensure of proper after sales support or timely service what there's no point in buying them. 

I had to wait for 20 days and yet ended up paying 4000 Rs extra then the market price just because of poor service by flipkart. NEVER BUY FROM FLIPKART


In spite of the lack of formal work experience I am applying for the aforementioned job of Analyst in the hope that my resume will justify the hunger of learning new things and the diversity of knowledge across various verticals like networking, algorithms, programming, cloud computing, online marketing and business operations as well.

I also hold Google Adwords Marketing professional certificate and got the opportunity to learn and interact with the Googlers. I am also the Microsoft Students Partner and am responsible to elevate the IT literacy for Microsoft products (especially Azure) to college students. 

I'd be my privileged to work with an organization of such esteem.
